# Ponzi

(In Progress) Current version works and new features are periodically being added

Imagine you wanted to start your own Ponzi Scheme. It's defintely harder than it seems. This game simulates what it would be like to start a Ponzi Scheme in New York City. Your goal is to recruit the entire city before you get caught. 

Choose a character and grow your "hedge fund," but don't get busted!
